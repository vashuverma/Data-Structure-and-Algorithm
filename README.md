# Data-Structure-and-Algorithm

Welcome to the Data Structure and Algorithm repository! This repository is dedicated to providing solutions and implementations of various data structures and algorithms commonly used in computer science and programming interviews. Whether you're preparing for technical interviews or simply interested in enhancing your understanding of fundamental concepts, this repository aims to be a valuable resource for you.
I also add the solution of  Daily leetcode problem of the day solution here.

# How to Use This Repository
Each data structure and algorithm is implemented C++.

Folder Structure: The implementations are organized into folders based on the type of data structure or algorithm. For example, implementations related to arrays can be found in the Arrays folder, while sorting algorithms are located in the Sorting folder.

Language: Implementations are provided in C++.
